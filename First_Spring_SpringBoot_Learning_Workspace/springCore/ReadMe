----------------------------------------------
video-6 - basically we can inject the data into bean class by using xml in various ways..
			1) by using setter method
			2) by using constructor more...
step - 1: creating MAVEN project
step - 2: adding dependencies => spring core,spring context. into pom.xml 
step - 3: creating beans-java POJO
step - 4: CREATING THE CONFIGURATION FILE => config.xml
		  Create a spring configuration file with any_name.xml in src/main/java
		  then we need to includes the name space of spring in this XML file from documentation
		  in the documentation file see the core technology where Configuration metadata content 
		  and open it and there XML file configuration will available for spring copy and past to 
		  here in XML file.
step - 5: main class: which can pull the object and use.
--------------------
video-6 - To inject the data to setters (primitive data types , collection data types)
		  in this video we have learn about that how to inject the primitive data to 
		  setters throw the configure file
	basically three way are there..
	example--
		<bean class="com.springcore.springCore.First" name="student1">
						<!-- 
						we can assigen or inject  the values of fileds or setter elements of 
						class  by using three ways..
						1s) using property and value tag
						2ns) using property tag and values as attribute
						3rd) using p schema for that we need to configure the 
						xmlns:p="http://www.springframework.org/schema/p" in XML file.  
						-->
						
		<!-- first way -->						 
		 <property name="student_id">
		 <value> 
		 50      
		 </value>
		 </property>
		 
		  <property name="studentName">
		 <value>   
		 RITIK SHARMA    
		 </value>
		 </property>
		 
		 <!--
		  <property name="student_Adds">
		 <value>      
		 USHRI KHURD POST HASANPURA 
		 </value>
		 </property>  -->
		 
		 <!-- 2nd  values as attribute of property tag not a tag as previous using p schema  -->
		 
		 <property name = "student_Adds" value = "DELHI"/>
		 
		 </bean>
		 
 <!---------  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ creating second bean object for storing data by using values as attribute not tag. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$-->
		 
		 <bean class="com.springcore.springCore.First" name="student2">
		 
		 <property name = "student_id" value = "21"/>
		 
		 <property name="studentName" value="Ankit sharma"/>
		
		 <property name="student_Adds" value="bihar siwan"/>
		 
		 </bean>
		 
		 
<!--------   $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ by using p schema other ways $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  -->
			 
			 <bean class="com.springcore.springCore.First" name="student3" p:student_id="011" p:studentName = "priyanshu sharma" p:student_Adds = "ushri bihar"/>

	How to inject collection types List , Set , Map and Properties | Spring Tutorial
	in this video we learn about that how to inject the collection data to setters 
	throws the configure file..
for List collection
	
	<bean>
	<property name = "property_name">
	<list>
	<value> value </value>
	<value> value </value>
	<value> value </value>
	<value> value </value>
	<null/>  // if you want to fill the null values.
	</list>
	</property>
	</bean>

for Set collection

	<bean>
	<property name = "property_name">
	<set>
	<value> value </value>
	<value> value </value>
	<value> value </value>
	<value> value </value>
	<null/>  // if you want to fill the null values.
	</set>
	</property>
	</bean>
	
for Map collection

	<bean>
	<property name = "property_name">
	<map>
		<enter key="key_value" value = "value"/>
		<enter key="key_value" value = "value"/>
		-------------
	</map>
	<property>
	</bean>


for Properties collection
	
	<bean>
	<property name="">
		<props>
			<prop key="name"> ....</prop>
			<prop key = "name">....</prop>
			..............................
		</props>
	<property>
	</bean>

-- for that see the package of com.springcore.collections---

-------------------------------------------------------------------------	
		
video-10
Injecting Reference Type Practical Video  - this is mostally using full.
--: basically when we have more than one object then to inject one object to depend on other on 
	we are using the Reference type 
	
	we can also configure the below code into p schema code
	
	ex- 
<bean class="com.springcore.Ref.A" name="aref" >
 <property name="x" value="12"/>
 <!--
 <property name="ob">
 	<ref bean="bref"/>
 </property>
  ### by other way in below
 -->
 <property name="ob" ref="bref" />
 
 </bean>
 
 	<!--	To p shema  --->
 <bean class="com.springcore.Ref.A" name="aref" p:x = "33" p:ob-ref="bref" />
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 video-11 -----------------
 
 constructor injection: we are going to call the constructor to inject 
 	step-1: create package name as com.springcore.Ci
 	step-2:create a bean class name person.java
 	step-3: write all the properties into bean Person class.
 	step-4:create bean configuration xml file name as CLconfig.xml
 	step-5: we are using the constructor injection for that we need
 			to use the <constructor-arg> tag to inject the properties
 			and one <constructor-arg> tag means configuration of one property
 			of bean class, so we need to write n numbers of <constructor-arg> as property
 	
 	step-6:we can use <constructor-arg> by threes ways
 			a) by tag
 			b)by parameter
 			c)by c-schema -> c-schema for constructor and p-schema for properties
 			d) in CIconfig.xml we are using the type tag to define the types of property 
 	step-7:create Test.java class (which is container)
 	
 	step-8: constructor injection with Reference(object) type
 	step-9: create a class name Certif.java bean  to give the Person class constructor and write some property 
 	step-10: to pass the Certif.java bean  to Person bean we need to create object for it by Ciconfig.xml file
 	step-11: configure the Certif.java by c-schema type see the xml code.
 
 example -- 
 <!-- using the c-schema -->
<bean class="com.springcore.Ci.Certi" name="cer" c:name="python programming language"/>
 	

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
video-12 Ambiguity Problem and its Solution with Constructor Injection 
---------
	step-1: creating a bean class name as Addition.java
	step-2: configure the details of this class to CIconfig.xml file 
	step-3: creating a two constructor in Addition bean which accept the arguments of 
			a) int , int 
			b) double , double
			then so here which constructor define first that only execute first 
			if int,int parameter contructor define fist then that will execute and second will override or
			if double , double parameter contructor define fist then that will execute.
			---- Note-----
			but in-case of string , string parameter constructor that will execute. this problem is called Ambiguity
	
	step-4: to change the default behavior of constructor we are using the type tag in CIconfig.xml file to identife the parameters type.
	step-5: we can also change the order of type parameter by config.xml  of bean constructor by using the index tag 
			the index tag by-default start with 0 index.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

video-13 Life Cycle methods of Spring Bean
----------
	step-1: when ever spring create a object of bean class then it will provides two
			important method for that every bean
			1) public void init() -> it is used to Initialization the code, means when we are loading the configuration file or connection to database , or webservice connection etc.
			 
			2)public void destory() -> to clean or destroy the connection code.
			
			note- we can change the name of this two method but can't change the syntax of this two.
	
	step-2: Life-cycle
		IOC container-> we car giving the spring bean to ioc container and its meta data(configuration.xml) then.
		step-a: it will create object for bean class
		step-b: setting the properties values of bean class
		step-c: then it will call the init method 
		step-d: after calling the init method we call read and use the bean 
		step-e: after perform all operation call the destroy method.
		
		note--
		to configure the bean class we can do by three ways
		1) by xml
		2)Spring intrface
		3)Annotation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

video-14 Implementing Life-cycle methods Using XML 
---------- implementation of init() method and destroy method
	step-1: create bean class name as Smasha.java
	 
	step-2: create Configure_lifeCycle.xml file and provide the details of bean class 
			with init method and destroy method
			
	step-3: create a Test.java(Container) and run it
	
	step4: in the output the init method will call and then other and after all destroy
			method also call but that will not execute,so  to controller it we are using the
			AbstractApplicatContext in container in-place of ApplicationContext.
 	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 video-15 Implementing bean life cycle using interfaces | IntializingBean | DisposableBean	
 	
 	step-1: we are going to learn about InitializingBean method and DisposableBean method
 			InitializingBean()-> to intialize the bean class
 			DisposableBean()-> to destroy the bean class
 	
 	step-2: creating the Pepsi.java bean class in com.springcore.springlifecycle.
 	step-3: give the details of Pepsi.java Bean class but no need to use here init() method and destroy() method details
 			in config.xml file beaucse we are using the two interface which will identify.
 	
 	step-4: give the details in Test.java (Container).
 	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
video-16 Implementing Bean LifeCyle using Annotations | @PostConstruct | @PreDestroy |

	step-1: @PostConstruct -> it gives the funcanality to after properties constructor run the function or method.
							so it works as init() method 
	step-2: @PreDestroy ->  works as destroy method.
	step-3: create a java bean name as Example.java
	step-4: gives the configuration of Example.java file to Configura_lifeCycle.xml file
	step-5: use the Test.java Container to create object for Bean class
	step-6: after above then to implement the init() an distroy method we are using the those two annocation
	step-7: write two method star and end an apply these annothentation on them but dy-default it will not support 
			so go-google and search Postconstruct spring
			a) go to - https://www.baeldung.com/spring-postconstruct-predestroy
			b) and add the this dependency in pom.xml to use those annotation
			ex- <dependency>
				    <groupId>javax.annotation</groupId>
				    <artifactId>javax.annotation-api</artifactId>
				    <version>1.3.2</version>
				</dependency>
	step-8: after apply the dependency also it don't work beauce it by-default has inable to able it we 
			have go to cong.xml file and to anable all the annotation we are writing

video-17 Autowiring in Spring Framework | Best Explanation

	step-1: Autowiring -> Feature of spring framework in which spring container inject the dependencies automatically.
						 it can't be used for inject the primitive data types and string it used for only reference(object) type.
 						c) in spring framework we are doing configuration by two ways 1) by mannualy 2) by automatically
 						d)autowiring can be done by two ways 1) by using XML 2) by using Annotation


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

video-18 Autowiring using XML complete Session | byName | byType | byConstructor |

	step-1: to undertand this concept we need to create two bean class where one class depends on other one
	step-2: create package name com.springcore.auto.write with bean class, configuration.xml file and test container class.
 	step-3: declare or define the dependent bean in autoConfig.XMl file 
 	step-4: here we can use the Autowiring inject beacuse address object is a Object types of Address class not in any primitive types.
 	step-5: when we are defining the Emp bean in conf.xml then if we are using the autowire="byName" Autowiring during define it then container 
 			will goes to inside the Emp.java bean and find that if any otherr beans are their to whom object name and config name are same.
 			------NOTE-------
 			here important note that the object name of dependent class in other class and conf.xml file must be same else it give null..
 	
 	step-6: creating Test.java(container) and run it
 	step-7: autowire="byType" -> if we define the main bean in conf.xml file with autowire="byName" then container
 								will search that if any object is in Emp and if yes then if that bean has define in 
 								confi.xml or not if yes then it will give the response respective 
 								so, oevrall in type container will check the bean class location which object has define in other one.(addresstype)
 	
 	step-8: --- note----------------
 			in the autowire="byType" here is a problem that if we have define more than one object for it then container will not able to correct that for which 
 			object it requesting so for that 
 	
 	step-9: autowire="constructor" -> when we are using this then parametarize constructor of main bean will call.
 	
 	
 	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
video-19 @Autowired Annotation for Autowiring | Autowiring in Spring Framework 

	step-1: copy the previous project with all the code and again setup based on package
	step-2: delete the autowire="constructor" from config.xml of main bean beause now we are going to
			do by appling the annotation on properties, constructor and setter method.
	
	step-3: apply on properties->  apply the @Autowired on properties and after apply enable the annotation 
			from confi.xml file
	
	example- 
	a)to apply the annotaion 
			@Autowired
		private Address address;
		
	 b) to enable the annotation on confi.xml
	  <!-- to enable to annotation -->
 		<context:annotation-config/>	
 	c) by apply this if we change the name of dependent bean from conf.xml that will not effect to it.
 	b) but if we are try to access more than one object of bean class then it will show error beacuse it not
 		able to figure out which object calling for resource. 
 		to figure out we are using the @Qualifier Annotation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

video-20 @Qualifier Annotation with Autowiring | Spring Framework 
-------------------
	step-1: @Qualifier Annotation -> by using @Qualifier we can give the bean object name at time of using 
			it below the @Autowired in main bean file then that bean object will run.
 	
 	step-2: we can apply this @Qualifier Annotation on properties and setter method but can't
 			apply on constructor 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
video-21 Spring Standalone Collections[List,Map,Properties] | Util Schema in Spring
	step-1: create a package name as com.springcore.standalone.collections
			and create Person bean class and Test.java container nad conf.xml file.
	step-2: to map the list types data we need to some change in xml file 
	example- 
	<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xmlns:context="http://www.springframework.org/schema/context"
    xmlns:p="http://www.springframework.org/schema/p"
    xmlns:util="http://www.springframework.org/schema/util"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
        classpath:/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/spring-beans.xsd
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/context
        classpath:/org/springframework/context/config/spring-context.xsd
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/util
        classpath:/org/springframework/beans/factory/xml/spring-util.xsd">
        
     step-3: add the code in config.xml  to store collection types
     
     exaple- 
     <!-- standalone list -->
    <util:list id="mybestfrineds" list-class="java.util.LinkedList">
        <value>aman</value>
        <value>Ankush</value>
        <value>Arman</value>
        <value>golu</value>
    </util:list>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
video-22 Stereotype Annotations | @Component Annotation | @Value Annotation
----------
	step-1: to create a object for bean class we need to give the details of that bean class
			by using the configuration XML file with <bean> tag but to ovide this process
			we can use the 	Stereotype Annotations  that will appear on class level.
	
	step-2: creating a package name as com.springcore.stereotype and create Student bean and Test conatiner
			with configuration.xml file.
 	
 	step-3: after create conf.xml file here we are not using any <bean> tag so inplace of that
 			we are using the below code 
 			<context:componets-scan base-package="package_name"/> 
 			example--
 			<context:componets-scan base-package="com.springcore.stereotype"/> 
 	
 	step-4: prepare Test container and run it then sucess full it will run but property value
 			we didn't give so value will come null.
 	
 	step-5: here one most import things that we didn't provides the beans name as we are proving
 			in conf.xml so during create object for bean class in which object name container
 			will create bean object so,
 			ans- is that in cammler leter of bean class means if name of bean class is Student then
 			object name must by create by container as student only.
 			
 	step-6: to display the valaue of each properties w need to use the @Valaue() Annotaion above 
 			that each and every value of Bean class, then value also will display.
 			
 			example -
 			@Value("Ritik ji sharma")
 	
	step-7: to give the instuction to container for creating the bean object name we can give the 
			bean object name at using @Component annotation.
			example - @Component()
					@Component("obj")

videp-24 Spring Bean Scope | Singleton | Prototype | how to configure scope spring
------------
	step-1: spring container follow some bean class scope and based on that scope it create object for them
			for spring there are basically some list of scopes are there
			a)Singleton-> this scope is by-default scope for spring container
			b)prototype -> 
			c)request-> this is basically used in web requesting
			d)session -> this is in web application when we store some thing in session object 
			e)globalsession -> it is specially for portlat application.
			
			-> in singleton type only one time container will create object for application
				and send again and again(single oject will be created by spring container)
			-> in prototype type every time object will create by container for application as peer user request.
	
	step-2: to figure out the object we can use the hashcode().
	step-3: by-defacult every bean object has Singleton scope so , to change there
			scope we have two types of understand the configure bean scope 
			
	-------- The configure bean scope can be two types 
		a)by xml file  -> 
		example -
			<bean class="" name="" scope=""/>
		b)by annotation->
		example -
			@Component
			@Scope("")
			class Student{
			-----

video-25 Spring Expression Language | SpEL | what is SpEL | How to use Expression 
------ 
	step-1: the spring expression language supports parsing and executing expression with the help of @Value annotations.
	step-2: we can apply the spEl on any things like on numeric values, methods, objects, etc.
	
	step-3: create a package name as com.springcore.spEL and respective create
			bean and container class and config.xml file also.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
video-26 How to invoke static method , variables and creating object | Spring Expression Language
---------
	step-1: to call the static method write below syntax in expression
			T(class).method(param)
	step-2: to pass the variable in expression 
			T(class).variable
	step-3: to pass the object type--> @Value("#{new java.lang.String('Ritik sharma')}")
	
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
video-27 Boolean type with SpEL | Spring Expression Language | Spring Framework 
-------------
	step-1: to set the values of boolean types properties of bean class we have
			to use a such condition in express which gives the boolean values
			and by-defalut its value is false.
		like--
		3>9 -> false
		5>2 -> true

video-28 Removing Complete XML for Spring Configuration | @Configuration | @ComponentScan | @Bean Annotation
--------------
	step-1: create a package name as com.springcore.removeXMl and create respective 
			bean class, container class nad xml file.
	step-2: after creating this three files and we are using the @Component Annotation in bean class 
			without giveing the package details in confi.xml of bean class and we are runing the container
			then it will give error beacuse it can't be find the particular package to create a bean object
			so,
			to overcome this problem we can do below things..
	step-3: delete the conf.xml file or remove configuration from xml file and 
			create a java class which acts as config.xml file by inherit some feactures
			to make a java class as configuration we are using the @Configuration annocation on that class to make it 
			to handle all the configuration details of bean class.
	
	step-4: to define the base package on this java class handle all the configuration 
			we can using the @ComponentScan(basePackages="package_name") annotaion on java class.
	
	step-5: after done above we have to write the AnnotaionConfigApplicationContext(java_class_name); in place of 
			ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("com/springcore/removeXMl/XmlRemoveConfig.xml"); then run it
	
	step-6: other way using the @Bean annotaion -by using the @Bean annotaion also we can create the object of bean
			by container but we have to apply this @Bean on a method in JavaConfig.java class then it will works as above
			and that method will return the bean object also no neet to using the @ComponentScan(basePackages="package_name") 
			and @Component("object")
	
	step-7: and one things we need to keep in mind that in bean class we don't provide any
			bean object name so that container will create bean object in that same name so,here
			container will create bean object a name of javaConfi.java method which return the 
			bean object.

	spring JDBC-->  a)spring jdbc is develope on top of jdbc which overcome the problems of jdbc
				    b)it used to communicate with java application to database
					c)java application <---> spring jdbc <--> database
					d)
	1) to create the object of jdbcTemplate class we need a store the dataSource object in jdbcTemplate
		property 
	2) a dataSource is nothing nut a interface which stored all the infor.. about our
		data related to connection with database. so,
		to create a object for dataSource interface we have a class which implemets this interface
		name as DriverManagerDataSource.
		
	3) IT has some methods 
		1) update()-> insert, update,etc..
		2)execute() ->select queries

			for thata we are using the @Component annotaion on StudentDaoIm class and @ComponentScan(basePackages ={"}) in JbcdConfig.java
			after that use the @Autowired

video-43 and 44 Spring ORM Complete Setup | New Project | Adding Dependencies in Detail | Spring ORM
--------
	step-1: create a Maven project name as SpringORM and follow same setup as preous
	step-2: download the dependency 
		1) spring-core
		2)spring-context
		3)spring-Hibernate
		
	
	step-3: creating packages com.spring.orm.dao and com.spring.orm.entities and congig.xml
			creating classes based on requirement.
	step-4: setting the Bean class and Dao class
	step-5:  after this all when we run the code then it will show the error that 
			'Write operations are not allowed in read-only mode 
			Turn your Session into FlushMode.COMMIT/AUTO or 
			remove 'readOnly' marker from transaction definition' 
			so, we need to declare one more dependecy in xml file of Hibernate TranscationManager .
			and add the annotaion on studentDao class to allow that method for write operation
			ex-
			@Transactional => to perform the write operation

------
	step-1: create a maven project and during creating maven project choose the 
			maven-archetype-webapp
	step-2: after create then maven project one error will come to jsp file to overcome that one 
			goto- build configuration and add the server.
	step-3: download the spring-mvc dependecy from maven website and paste to pom.xml
	ex-
			<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework/spring-webmvc -->
			<dependency>
			    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
			    <artifactId>spring-webmvc</artifactId>
			    <version>5.2.4.RELEASE</version>

------------------video-54: Configuring and Code our spring mvc project in just 5 steps-----------------------------------
---------
---------- 1st creating configure file of dispatcher servlet class -------------------
	step-1: 1st configure the dispatcher servlet in web.xml file
		exam
		-----
		<!-- configure the dispatcher servlet-->
		  <servlet>
			  <servlet-name>spring1</servlet-name>
			  <servlet-class>org.springframework.web.servlet.DispatcherServlet</servlet-class>
		  </servlet>
		  <servlet-mapping>
			  <servlet-name>spring1</servlet-name>
			  <!-- / this is for define for all the request-->
			  <url-pattern>/</url-pattern>
		  </servlet-mapping>
---------------2nd creating spring configure file -------------------------------			
	step-2: 2nd create spring configuration file -> this file must be contain the dispatcher name which
			we define in web.xml
		example- spring1-servlet.xml
		------
	step-3: take configuration code of xml from previous project.
	
----------3rd configure view resource----------------------------
	step-4: view resource -> the view resource is noting but it is simple bean class which is provided
			by java. so for the class we have to import by identify the proper class name by
			click on enclip cntr + shift+ t 
	step-5: 
	exapme--
		<!-- this is for InternalResourceViewResolver class-->
		  <bean 
		  class="org.springframework.web.servlet.view.InternalResourceViewResolver" 
		  name="viewResolver">   
		  
		  <property name="prefix" value="/WEB-INF/views" />
		  <property name="suffix" value=".jsp"/>
		  </bean>
	
------ 4th create Controller --------------------------------
	step-6: to create controller we have create a class on package  and implements the @Controller 
			annotation on that class top-up
	step-7: creating methods-> we are creating methods in that controller class to handle
			the URL. for that we need to use the @RequestMapping("_names") annotation.

-----------5th creating views ---------------------------------
	step-8: creating a folder name views in WEB-INF and after it create all the jsp files in that location only.

video-55 and 56 Sending Data From Controller to View | Full Concept Explain |
--------
	step-1: we can send the data from controller by two ways 
			1) by using model- we are going to send the data from model(data)object by using the 
			addAttribute(String key,Object value) where String key is the key name to set that value 
			so that when we are try to access it so by using that key we can access and Object value is
			that object which we are sending.
			
			2) by using ModelAndView.->by using addObject(String key , Object value).
	
	step-2: setting the data into controller by using model and getting it from home.jsp by 
			dynamically.

video-57 JSP Expression Language to Print Values in Spring MVC Views | JSTL for traversing
---------------
	step-1: to use jsp Expression in jsp page so that we can get the values without using the 
			getAttribute() method of request for that we need to de-activate the pageEgnure in jsp
			by following the syntax.
			example--   ${name}
			
			<h2>name : 
 			<%-- <%= name %>  --%>
 
 			 ${name}
			</h2>	
	
	step-2: to display the collaction types data - when we are displaying the data of collection types
			then that data will come in array formate to display them in each new line we are using the 
			JSTL concept of JSP.
			to use the JSTL in jsp we have to download the dependeny of it from maven and past in pom.xml
			example--
			
			<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/jstl/jstl -->
			<dependency>
			    <groupId>jstl</groupId>
			    <artifactId>jstl</artifactId>
			    <version>1.2</version>
			</dependency>
						
	step-3: to set the JSTL in jsp page we need to use the below code from oracle by searching the jstl url on chrome
	example--
	 		<%@ taglib prefix="c" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" %>
